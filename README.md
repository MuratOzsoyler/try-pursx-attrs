# `pursx` can not parse (some) non-ASCII attribute contents

This project lists only some of them, may be there are more

Just comment out current working `~~` line and uncomment whichever you want to test.

Note that this is only an inconvenience. You can inject any attribute with desired content via code. 
But if HTML is generated by a utility, changing some attrs to code is cumbersome. 
Also attr definition which is not changed, clutters and lengthens the code unnecessarily.
